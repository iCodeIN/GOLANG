ShellSort


Similar to insertion sort.
In Insertion sort we compare two consecutive elements everytime.
In shell sort we pick elements which are placed far away and do sorting
Preferably at distances (3x+1)

By taking long distances to swap we are reducing the number of steps required to move
to sorted position
