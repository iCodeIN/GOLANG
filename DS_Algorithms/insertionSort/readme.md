take a key value which is the second element in array
a[1]

2. After this check if the key value is less than the previous element
if yes then swap the elements.

In the next iteration increment i
for i = 2
do step 2 two times
1. check a[1] > key  { swap}
2. chek a[0] > key {swap }

Simply put placing the keyVal in the respective position.
first iteration compare key val with 1 pos
second iteration compare with 2 pos
third iteration compare with 3 pos
