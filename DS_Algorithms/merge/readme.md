Merge functioning

we will 3 positions

i which is the first array
j which is the second array
k is the resultant array

we will compare ith element of the first array with the jth element of the second array.
if i is > j then a[k] = a[j]
if it is < then a[k] = a[i]

if at then end any array elements are left out fill it in the resultant array
